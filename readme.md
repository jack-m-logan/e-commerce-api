# e-Ecommerce API (WIP)

To add to final readme file:

This project has been a great opportunity to test create an API locally from scratch - if I were to do it again, I would update the project with 'real' data (or at least fake data that accuratley corresponds across all tables) and create functions (modularly?) to update quantities of products, delete products, update prices etc. 

Would also try with promises to implement improved error handling and more current syntax.
